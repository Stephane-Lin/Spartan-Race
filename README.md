Spartan-Race
============

Text-based multiplayer board game

There are two ways to initiate this game:
  1. Regular mode: each player (2-4) rolls the dice every turn
  2. Debug mode: all necessary information is written in a specific text file; the game runs by itself until it encounters a winner or an error.
  
The output of the game (player's inputs, errors, board) are exported out to a text file at the end of the game.
There are no executable .jar file as there are no GUI components.
